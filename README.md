# STock-Market-ExchangeProject Title: Stock Price Prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Project Goal: To build a machine learning model that can predict the future price of a stock with reasonable accuracy. This project uses historical stock data to train a model that can learn trends and patterns in the data to make future predictions.

Key Concepts:

Stock Market Data: This is the historical data of a particular stock, which includes features like the opening price, closing price, high price, low price, and trading volume for each day. In your project, you are using the yfinance library to download data for Apple (AAPL).
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): This is a special type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is well-suited for time-series data like stock prices. LSTMs are capable of learning long-term dependencies, which is crucial for understanding the trends in stock market data.
Data Preprocessing: Before feeding the data to the model, it needs to be preprocessed. This includes:
Data Scaling: Scaling the data to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) helps the model to learn more effectively. You are using MinMaxScaler for this purpose.
Creating Training and Testing Sets: The data is split into a training set (used to train the model) and a testing set (used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data).
Creating Time-Stepped Data: LSTMs require the data to be in a specific format, typically a sequence of past data points (e.g., the last 60 days of stock prices) to predict the next data point (the next day's price).
Model Building: This involves creating the LSTM model architecture. Your model consists of:
Two LSTM layers to capture the temporal dependencies in the data.
Two Dense layers to produce the final output.
Model Training: The model is trained on the training data using an optimizer like 'adam' and a loss function like 'mean_squared_error'.
Model Evaluation: The trained model is then used to make predictions on the test data. The predicted prices are compared with the actual prices to evaluate the model's performance.
Prediction: Finally, the model can be used to predict the next day's stock price.
Project Outcome: The final outcome of this project is a trained LSTM model that can be used to predict future stock prices. The predictions can be visualized against the actual prices to get a better understanding of the model's performance. You can also save the trained model for future use.
